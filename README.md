<h1> Marketing Platforms used for tracking and as a data source for future analysis / reports: </h1>
<br/><br/>
<h2>1) Google Ads</h2>
<h2>2) AdRoll</h2>
<h2>3) TikTok</h2>
<h2>4) META</h2>
<h2>5) GA-4 (As a main listener)</h2>

<h1> Tracking set-up for various platforms</h1>
<br/><br/>
Main deployment of all pixelx for all Marketing Platform for various clients was used via <B>GTM (Google Tag Manager).</B>
<br/><br/>
<b>Upside</b> - once GTM is installed most of the marketing tracking can be set-up without backend support from the dev.team (unless some specific criteria must be met that involve Data Layer editing) and it provides good amount of ways to track customers behaviour on the website (via Events, Tags and Triggers).
<br/><br/>
<b>Downside</b> - GTM is a code-injection tool prone to security vulnerabilities. Since GTM is a code injection tool, it can be blocked by ad blockers (which scews the data that is received on all Marketing Platforms)
<br/><br/>
GTM instllation is fairly straight-forward: A code snipet (generated by the GTM) is installed on all pages of the website (in HEAD and BODY of the page)

Successful installation of the GTM can be tracked via various Google Chrome addons or by manually inspecting the page for the code snippet
